 * (`registerGetIncident` calls `loadUiResource('incident-detail')`, etc.),
 * but the function is exported and could be misused; the allowlist removes
 * that concern entirely.
 *
 * Mirrors `UI_TOOLS` in `scripts/ui-tools.mjs` — keep in sync. There's no
 * import-from-mjs path that works in both production tsc + test vitest, so
 * the list is duplicated. The `tests/unit/ui/build.test.ts` BUNDLES array
 * + `npm run build:ui` are the canonical drift-detectors: a slug present
 * here but missing from UI_TOOLS won't have a built bundle, so
 * `loadUiResource` will throw a build-hint error at startup.
